Test OpenLab CI

This is a [Service Broker](https://docs.cloudfoundry.org/services/overview.html) for Huawei Cloud.
It also can be used for Flexible Engine and Open Telekom Cloud.
Currently it includes the following services support:
* [Distributed Cache Service (DCS)](http://www.huaweicloud.com/en-us/product/dcs.html)
* [Distributed Message Service (DMS)](http://www.huaweicloud.com/en-us/product/dms.html)
* [Object Storage Service (OBS)](http://www.huaweicloud.com/en-us/product/obs.html)
* [Relational Database Service (RDS)](http://www.huaweicloud.com/en-us/product/rds.html)

Different Clouds have different services, the users will be required to make their own configurations in the following ```Installation``` so that this Service Broker can be running normally.

Note: You can setup a backing MySQL Database by using the following choices.
We recommend to use the choice 1.

* Create database instance by running the following command
    ```
    CREATE DATABASE broker;
    ```

### Choice 2: Setup a Backing MySQL Database by yourself

* Setup a MySQL Server and make sure that the database can be accessed by service broker
* Login in MySQL with your account and password
* Create database instance by running the following command
    ```
    CREATE DATABASE broker;
    ```
* Create database user by running the following command
    ```
    CREATE USER 'username'@'%' IDENTIFIED BY 'password';
    ```
* Grant privileges to the user by running the following command
    ```
    GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON broker.* TO 'username'@'%' WITH GRANT OPTION;
    FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
    ```
* Make sure MySQL can be connected remotely
    ```
    vi /etc/mysql/mysql.conf.d/mysqld.cnf
